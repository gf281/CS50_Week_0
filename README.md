# CS50_Week_0
# This project is a simple shooter. Each shot (mouse 1; left click) costs one "shot" (recorded as a variable in the upper left) and is fired towards where the mouse is pointing. Upon hitting a green enemy, you are granted a point and an extra shot, and the shot changes direction to point towards the cursor again. This mechanic is intended to allow you to shoot multiple enemies with a single shot. You may move using the W, A, S &amp; D keys. When an enemy touches you or you run out of shots, the game ends.
